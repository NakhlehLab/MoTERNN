# MoTERNN: Classifying the Mode of Tumor Evolution using Recursive Neural Networks
Tumor evolutionary models have different implications in cancer patients' clinical diagnosis, prognosis, and therapeutic treatment. Four major evolutionary models have been proposed; namely, Linear, Branching, Neutral, and Punctuated models, which are identified from tumor phylogenetic trees. We automated this identification process by defining it as an instance of graph classification problem on phylogenetic trees. Specifically, we employed Recursive Neural Networks to capture the tree structure of tumor phylogenies while predicting the mode of evolution. We trained our model, MoTERNN, using simulated data in a supervised fashion and applied it to a real phylogenetic tree obtained from single-cell DNA-seq data. Here you have access to the PyTorch implementation of MoTERNN and the scripts used for generating simulated data.
